# TODO REST API with .net core

TODO This template implements a REST service using .NET Core
and aims to incorporate industry best practices. The intention is to keep this repository updated, allowing new services to leverage the template.

It will be generated for .net 10, but more version will be
supported as new framework are released along the time.

## Getting started

We are developers, we like to get our hands dirty and try the
code by ourselves, so let's have some fun.

git clone https://github.com/little-engineer-2025/template-dotnet
